## Tasks

### 1. Create product listing page

- Create a route called `/products` where you will have a full width page with a header, a footer and a main section.
- The page should be fully responsive.
- Add toggle option between list and grid view
- The main section should be populated with products coming from an HTTP request to an endpoint containing the data from a `products.json`
- Each product should include
  - Image thumbnail
  - Product name
  - Product price (current, was and discount price),
  - Size
  - Link to `url` key
  - Add favourite
- Desktop design for products layout is provided in `<root>/plp-design.png`
- Add Unit Tests
- Add comments on what other improvements would you add to this page
- **Optional task:** The data set is reasonably large so we need to be able to:
  - **filter the data by:** category, price, size
  - **sort the data by:** price (ascending), price (descending) and name (ascending)

### 2. Create dashboard

- Create a route called `/dashboard` where you will have a full width page with a header, a footer and a main section.
- Prepare three components:
  - The first component should display a list of posts from this endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. There should be button "Remove" next to each item in the list
  - The second component should display a list of photos from this endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos. There should be button "Remove" next to each item in the list
  - The third component should be named "Removed Items". When the user clicks on the "Remove" buttons, the item should be removed from the list and should be presented in the "Removed Items" component. Please try to avoid using `@Input` and `@Output` decorators.
- Add Unit Tests
